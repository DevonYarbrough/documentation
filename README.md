Documentation
=============

This is the documentation for the various Ethers projects.

The current projects documented here are:

- **ethers.js** - The Ethereum JavaScript library
- **ethers-app** - The application library and toolchain for ethers.io and ethers.space.

**Coming soon:**

- **ethers.objc** - The Ethereum Objective-C library
- **ethers.ino** - The Ethereum Arduino C library
- **ethers-ens** - The ENS registration library and command-line tools
- **ethers-build** - The testing, debugging and deployment library and tools; this is largely covered in the **ethers-app** documentation above, but this will be the low-level API for hacking into the framework
